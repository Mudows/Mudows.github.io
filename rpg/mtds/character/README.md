<summary>Bugs to Fix :beetle:</summary>

- [ ] If the user clicks the value of the skill instead of the name, the function won't update the number of available choices properly and wont't remove the flag that indicates it was chosen as either good or bad skill;
- [ ] When removing the 'good' or 'bad' flag from skills to reset it to 'normal', the counter of available Good and Bad skill choices do not update. It only updates after choosing a new Good or Bad skill;
- [ ] When setting attribute points, if you have already spent all points but need to subtract point to relocate, instead of subtracting only 1, it subtracts 2;
- [ ] If the name of the character is the last thing to be chosen to create the character, the 'Finalizar' button do not enable unless atribute points are relocated or skills are changed;
