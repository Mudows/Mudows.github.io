# Simple JavaScript Games
These are simple JavaScript games that I'm making for JS practice. I'm using the freeCodeCamp YouTube tutorials for these, but modifying the code as I see fit and learn more about the language.

### Games Status

* Rock-Paper-Scissors (*needs fixing ASAP*);
  * Logic broken on last update. Included image instead or words for the options, and now the JS have no idea what to do with it to run the game.
* Memory Game (*works, buuuuut...*);
  * There is a bug where you can click the same image and it will count as a match.
* Whac-a-Mole (*Base is done, but far from ideal*);
  * Needs a proper reset function and a end game score message.
* Breakout (*in development*);
* Frogger (*on queue*);
* Connect Four (*on queue*);
* Space Invaders (*on queue*)
